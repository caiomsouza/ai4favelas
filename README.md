### What does Favela means?

Brazilian shantytown, favela, also spelled favella, in Brazil, a slum or shantytown located within or on the outskirts of the country's large cities, especially Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. A favela typically comes into being when squatters occupy vacant land at the edge of a city and construct shanties of salvaged or stolen materials. Source: https://www.britannica.com/topic/favela

### The size of the problem

According to the United Nations, almost a third of the world's urban population lives in slums. <BR>
As a result of increasing urbanization, the number will increase significantly in the future. Up to 2 billion people may live in slums in 2030. <BR><BR>

With a total number of 11 million dwellers, Favelas are a major urban policy issue in Brazil.<BR>
